# Alpine local repository with docker
Alpine's Docker repository for local Alpine-based developments. Nginx and synchronization on external volume

* Built on the lightweight and secure Alpine Linux distribution
* Small docker image size
* Nginx, rsync and supervisor
* The servers Nginx, rsync and supervisord run under a non-privileged user (nobody) to make it more secure
* The logs of all the services are redirected to the output of the Docker container (visible with `docker logs -f <container name>`)
* Follows the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) to make it easy to understand and adjust the image to your needs 
* Run rsync every hour without overlapping
